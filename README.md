# Secure Elements

## Overview

Secure elements are tamper-resistant hardware components designed to securely store cryptographic keys and execute sensitive operations. These elements provide a high level of security against physical and logical attacks, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of cryptographic processes.

## Examples of Secure Elements

Secure elements come in various forms, including:

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: Dedicated devices that manage cryptographic keys and perform encryption/decryption operations.
- **Secure Smart Modules (SSMs)**: Embedded security components used in industrial and IoT applications.
- **Smartcards**: Small chip-based cards used for authentication and secure transactions (e.g., SIM cards, payment cards, ID cards).
- **Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)**: Specialized chips used in computers to store cryptographic keys and ensure platform integrity.
- **Embedded Secure Elements**: Built-in security chips found in mobile devices, IoT devices, and payment terminals.

## Vendors

Several companies manufacture secure elements, including:

- **Thales** (formerly Gemalto)
- **Yubico** (YubiKey security tokens)
- **Infineon Technologies**
- **NXP Semiconductors**
- **Entrust**
- **Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)**
- **Utimaco**
- **Microchip Technology**
