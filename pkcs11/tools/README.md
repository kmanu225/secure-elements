# Try PKCS#11  

The best way to learn PKCS#11 is to use it, whether on a real cryptographic device or an emulated one. This repository aims to share source code for working with real cryptographic devices using PKCS#11.  

## SoftHSM  

SoftHSM (Software Hardware Security Module) is an emulated HSM that provides a convenient environment to experiment with PKCS#11 without needing physical hardware. Itâ€™s ideal for development and testing.  

## Usage  

You can interact with PKCS#11 through:  

- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Tools provided by the product owner to manage cryptographic keys and operations.  
- **Programming Interfaces:** Integrate PKCS#11 into applications with languages like Java, Python, C.
